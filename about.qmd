Hi! My name is Kandace Loualhati (Loo-uhl-haw-tee). I'm currently a second year at Pomona College who's intending on double majoring in Politics and Cognitive Science (with a computational concentration). I'm also a coffee addict (whoops!), an avid adventurer, and have my Seal of Biliteracy in American Sign Language :)
