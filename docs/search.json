In this analysis, I counted how many times Jim said the name “Pam” / “Pamela” per episode in every season. The graph is also color-coded by season: getting a lighter shade of blue as the seasons progress. Based on the data, Jim said the name “Pam” the most on episode 4 collectively throughout every season, and this trend would decrease the longer a season went on. Ultimately, Jim referenced “Pam” in 123 episodes throughout the course of the TV show."

The only difference for this specific plot is that the relationship between the mean absorbance (scaled from 0-1) and frequency (with a range of 200-8000 Hz) is based on the age of participants. The ages range from 19-21, including differences in ages based on half a year (i.e. 19.5, 20.5). Unlike the previous plot, there is no obvious peak, but rather an area (between 1000-6000 Hz) for the approximate max absorbance. There appears to not be a strong relationship based on the age; however, due to the difference being only two years, this would most likely have more significant results as the ages continue to increase. Note that the graph, although mostly accurate, is limited due to the restriction of the data to 100,000 in order for my computer to cooperate. With the full data, the graph may change slightly."

First, I had to individually limit, using the WHERE function, the “ear_df” data frame to the original twelve studies in the desired plot as well as the range of the Frequency variable. After that, the line plot was quite simple to recreate, but I had to scale the Y axis using the log10 function. Then, in the second half of the assignment, I made a new graph of Mean Absorbance and Frequency based on the Age variable in the Subjects data frame; however, due to the Subjects dataframe being extremely large, my computer was not loading after my attempt to join it with Measurements. After a while, I decided to limit the frame to 100,000 units and then the data frame had no problem producing in my Environment. I then made another line plot depicting this relationship."

There is not strong enough evidence against the null hypothesis; however, if I were to repeat this analysis, I would do another permutation test using variables for both the baby’s sex and the father’s X/Y ratio, for there may be a stronger relationship there. Currently, there is not much research on this correlation, so I’d most likely need to conduct my own research or wait until somebody believes that this imbalance in the probability of sexes is significant enough to explore, despite the P-Value."
