## Experience {style="color: black"}

**Restaurant Manager**

Managed a local restaurant, Stonefire Grill, from January 2025 until March 2026; ultimately, being employed with the company for three years while as an undergraduate, and working full-time while being a full-time student for a little over a year. There, I was able to minimize business costs by analyzing labor statistics on Toast as well as our Daily Labor Tool, maximize profit by upselling, building relationships with guests, and coaching staff, and learn how to predict business based on previous week/year trends.

**Research**

Served as a researcher in Computational Chemistry and Novel Drug Design under the guidance of Roberto A. Garza-Lopez.

**College Adviser**

Assisted students with the college application process and provided academic advising to students.
